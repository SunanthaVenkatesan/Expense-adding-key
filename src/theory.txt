//use state returns array and will always have two values and 1st is the current state and 2nd is the function for updating value
  //is a hook and should bde called only inside a function and not even inside nested function 
  //use state will create a special kind of variable for eventhandler
 
  //const [amount,setAmount] =useState(props.amount)


  //using props we can make the component reusable and allows us to pass data from another component--key concept
  //the custom component must start with uppercase as we are using as JSX and react should detect as custom since lowercase are for default builtin HTML elements
  //const clickHandler=()=>{//is a fucntion that is atatched to the event listener and that is called upon the trigger of event 
    
    //setTitle("updated!")//this will not just call the function but,the whole component will be called again 
    //console.log(title)
  //}
  /*const addclickHandler=()=>{
    setAmount(+100)
    console.log(amount)
  }*/

ARRAY MAP INDEXING 
  All the items in the react will look similar for it and only upon instruction it will know to add the items in the 
  correct place ,So KEY is required for that and it updates the list in more efficient way
